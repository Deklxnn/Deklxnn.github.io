Hi! I don't know why you're here, but welcome.
This is a project I made for my brother, but you are welcome to use it. Don't try to understand my code, its horribly unorganized.

You can use this app to record driver times like in a Formula 1 kind of style or something. It's really simple to use, so have fun.
